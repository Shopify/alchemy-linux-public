# Built by Shopify, inspired by tumblr

The Alchemy Linux is a part of the "Genesis" stack, which is inspired by tumblr's infrastructure management and Source of Truth Stack.

tumblr uses a tool called "Invisible Touch", a Linux distro to run jobs as dispatched by "Phil", based on information stored in "Collins".

While Collins was Open Sourced, Phil and Invisible Touch were not.

[Shopify](http://www.shopify.com) has implemented their own version of these two components, and in an attempt to avoid confusion, has chosen an "Alchemy" theme.

This component is called "Alchemy Linux", and replaces tumblr's "Invisible Touch". Admittedly, tumblr's names are much cooler.

This site is an attempt to provide some documentation, examples, and help with deploying / hacking.

# Acknowledgement

The work for Alchemy Linux is based on a script that was shared by [Box Inc.](https://www.box.com/), which was a much simpler, more light-weight replacement for Invisible Touch, but not as general-purpose.
