# Built by Shopify, inspired by tumblr

The Alchemy Transmuter is a part of the "Genesis" stack, which is inspired by tumblr's infrastructure management and Source of Truth Stack.

tumblr uses a tool called "Phil" to render iPXE menus for a Linux distro called "Invisible Touch" based on information stored in "Collins".

While Collins was Open Sourced, Phil and Invisible Touch were not.

[Shopify](http://www.shopify.com) has implemented their own version of these two components, and in an attempt to avoid confusion, has chosen an "Alchemy" theme.

This component is called "Alchemy Transmuter", and replaces tumblr's "Phil". Admittedly, tumblr's names are much cooler.

This page is an attempt to provide some documentation, examples, and help with deploying / hacking.
